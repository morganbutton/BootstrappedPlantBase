## Compile SCSS files

To compile the SASS files to CSS you can use the following guide.
Note: This is not required, you can always use your own SASS compiler or just use CSS.

### Requirements

- NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/)

### Installation

1. Open your console
2. Navigate to the root folder of Milo
3. Run "npm install" and wait
4. 	- Run "npm start" while developing. This will automatically start a dev server at http://localhost:8080 and detect changes in the SASS files
	- Run "npm run build" to compile the SASS files to a minified CSS-file
	- Run "npm run watch" to compile and watch the SASS files

### Customize

To customize Milo for your needs, simple edit the included SASS files. Those files are located in /src/css/. Theme variables (like colours and fonts) are located in _variables.scss.
